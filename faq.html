                    <p class="question">Where do I write my novel? Do I type it on the NaNoWriMo website?</p>
                    <p class="answer">You write your novel using your own materials: on your preferred word-processing program, by hand, by typewriter, etc. You do not type it directly on the NaNoWriMo or Camp NaNoWriMo site.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <p class="question">How do I update my word count? How often should I update it?</p>
                    <p class="answer">You can update your word count by entering your total cumulative count in the field on the top of your screen and hitting “Update.”

Update your word count as frequently or infrequently as you’d like. We recommend a daily update!</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <p class="question">How do I win NaNoWriMo? What are the prizes? Is there an entry fee?</p>
                    <p class="answer">You win NaNoWriMo by writing 50,000 words of your novel between November 1 and November 30. (Or during Camp NaNoWriMo, just reaching your personal word-count goal.) There’s no limit on how many people can win! Just be sure that you’ve defined a novel on our site, and that you validate your novel’s word count at the end of the month.

Every year, we have several generous sponsors that offer participant and winner goodies. Check out the NaNoWriMo prizes here, and Camp NaNoWriMo prizes here!

All programs for National Novel Writing Month, Camp NaNoWriMo, and the Young Writers Program are free. However, we run on donations, and we do ask ably-financed participants to contribute something towards hosting and administrative costs. Because we’re a nonprofit, the donation is tax-deductible!</p>

                    <p class="question">How do I add or remove a writing buddy?</p>
                    <p class="answer">To add a writing buddy on the NaNoWriMo site, go to the profile of the person you’d like to buddy and click on the “Add as Buddy” button to the right of the username.

Finding a buddy’s profile can be a bit tricky! If you meet someone in the forums, you can click on their username to reach their profile page. If you’re using our search function, be sure to use the exact username you’re searching for; if it’s even a little off, our search functionality won't find it.

To remove a buddy, simply go to his or her profile again and hit the “Remove buddy” button.</p>

                    <p class="question">Can I participate if I’m not American? Can I write a novel in any language?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Definitely! We’re an international nonprofit with participants around the world. 

You’re welcome to write in whichever language you’re most comfortable with. Unfortunately, our word-count validator doesn’t read non-Latin characters properly, so we encourage you to generate an estimated word count using a random-text generator.</p>

                <div>
                    <p class="question">Why 50,000 words? And how do you define “novel”?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Our experiences since 1999 show that 50,000 is a difficult but doable goal, even for people with full-time jobs and children. The length makes it a short novel (about the length of The Great Gatsby). We don’t use the word “novella” because it doesn’t seem to impress people the way “novel” does.

We define a novel as “a lengthy work of fiction.” Beyond that, we let you decide whether what you’re writing falls under the heading of “novel.” In short: If you believe you’re writing a novel, we believe you’re writing a novel, too.

On Camp NaNoWriMo, we’re open to word counts from 10,000 to 999,999. So bring on those short stories and epics!</p>

                    <p class="question">How and when can I sign up? When do I start writing?</p>
                    <p class="answer">You can sign up at any time, year-round. To sign up for the upcoming National Novel Writing Month, just click on the “Sign Up” button on the homepage.

You can start writing at the stroke of midnight on November 1.

On Camp NaNoWriMo, you can participate in April and July.</p>

                    <p class="answer">NaNoWriMo and Camp NaNoWriMo are open to all writers over the age of 13. Our Young Writers Program is open to authors 17 and under.</p>

                    <p class="question">How can I be sure my novel is protected?</p>
                    <p class="answer">To protect your privacy and rights to your work, none of the novels submitted to our site are read by another human. The text is submitted to our server, run through our word-count validator, and then immediately deleted.

This means we do not keep any copies of your novel, so be sure to back up your hard work!</p>

                    <p class="answer">The only requirement is to congratulate yourself on your hard work.

That said, many NaNoWriMo and Camp NaNoWriMo participants revise their manuscripts—to publish traditionally, to self-publish, or just to share their stories with friends and family. We support this process during our "Now What?" Months.</p>

On Camp NaNoWriMo, you can also use your existing NaNoWriMo login.

For security purposes, our Young Writers Program website is not linked to the NaNoWriMo or  Camp NaNoWriMo sites. To participate on those sites, you can create a new account with the same email address you use on YWP.</p>

You can delete your current account on the “Account Settings” page, and then create a new one 30 days after deletion. (Your email address will be freed up once the deletion is permanent.)</p>

If you no longer have access to the original email address you used to sign up and have forgotten your password, you’ll need to start over with a new account.</p>

To change or update any of that information, just click the “Edit” button on your “My Novels” page.</p>
