                    <p class="question">Where do I write my novel? Do I type it on the NaNoWriMo website?</p>
                    <p class="answer">You write your novel using your own materials: on your preferred word-processing program, by hand, by typewriter, etc. You do not type it directly on the NaNoWriMo or Camp NaNoWriMo site.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <p class="question">How do I update my word count? How often should I update it?</p>
                    <p class="answer">You can update your word count by entering your total cumulative count in the field on the top of your screen and hitting “Update.”

Update your word count as frequently or infrequently as you’d like. We recommend a daily update!</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <p class="question">How do I win NaNoWriMo? What are the prizes? Is there an entry fee?</p>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>You win NaNoWriMo by writing 50,000 words of your novel between November 1 and November 30. (Or during Camp NaNoWriMo, just reaching your personal word-count goal.) There’s no limit on how many people can win! Just be sure that you’ve defined a novel on our site, and that you validate your novel’s word count at the end of the month.</p>

<p>Every year, we have several generous sponsors that offer participant and winner goodies. Check out the NaNoWriMo prizes here, and Camp NaNoWriMo prizes here!</p>

<p>All programs for National Novel Writing Month, Camp NaNoWriMo, and the Young Writers Program are free. However, we run on donations, and we do ask ably-financed participants to contribute something towards hosting and administrative costs. Because we’re a nonprofit, the donation is tax-deductible!</p>

                    <p class="question">How do I add or remove a writing buddy?</p>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>To add a writing buddy on the NaNoWriMo site, go to the profile of the person you’d like to buddy and click on the “Add as Buddy” button to the right of the username.</p>

<p>Finding a buddy’s profile can be a bit tricky! If you meet someone in the forums, you can click on their username to reach their profile page. If you’re using our search function, be sure to use the exact username you’re searching for; if it’s even a little off, our search functionality won't find it.</p>

<p>To remove a buddy, simply go to his or her profile again and hit the “Remove buddy” button.</p>

                        <p>Definitely! We’re an international nonprofit with participants around the world. </p>

<p>You’re welcome to write in whichever language you’re most comfortable with. Unfortunately, our word-count validator doesn’t read non-Latin characters properly, so we encourage you to generate an estimated word count using a random-text generator.</p>

                    <p class="question">Why 50,000 words? And how do you define “novel”?</p>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Our experiences since 1999 show that 50,000 is a difficult but doable goal, even for people with full-time jobs and children. The length makes it a short novel (about the length of The Great Gatsby). We don’t use the word “novella” because it doesn’t seem to impress people the way “novel” does.</p>

<p>We define a novel as “a lengthy work of fiction.” Beyond that, we let you decide whether what you’re writing falls under the heading of “novel.” In short: If you believe you’re writing a novel, we believe you’re writing a novel, too.</p>

<p>On Camp NaNoWriMo, we’re open to word counts from 10,000 to 999,999. So bring on those short stories and epics!</p>

                        <p>You can sign up at any time, year-round. To sign up for the upcoming National Novel Writing Month, just click on the “Sign Up” button on the homepage.</p>

<p>You can start writing at the stroke of midnight on November 1.</p>

                        <p>To protect your privacy and rights to your work, none of the novels submitted to our site are read by another human. The text is submitted to our server, run through our word-count validator, and then immediately deleted.</p>

<p>This means we do not keep any copies of your novel, so be sure to back up your hard work!</p>

                        <p>The only requirement is to congratulate yourself on your hard work.</p>

<p>That said, many NaNoWriMo and Camp NaNoWriMo participants revise their manuscripts—to publish traditionally, to self-publish, or just to share their stories with friends and family. We support this process during our "Now What?" Months.</p>

<p>If you’re entering your novel, choose the current event for which you wish to define your novel (for example, "November 2015"). Fill in any of the fields you'd like; all are optional.

<p>We recommend using the JPG format for most images on this site. When you upload, the image file will be resized. For best results, try to make your image fit the size requirements: 230 x 300 pixels.</p>

                    <p class="question">What if I don’t finish? Or hit my word-count goal but I’m only halfway through my novel?</p>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right? Even if you end the month 49,000 words short, that’s 1,000 words you wouldn’t have otherwise.</p>

<p>Consider the word-count goal a threshold, not necessarily a stopping place. Reaching that goal and realizing you still have a lot of wrapping up to do is a good thing: it gives you something to come back to and work on later. You will still win if you reach your goal but have not yet completed your novel. Keep writing!</p>

Update your word count as frequently or infrequently as you’d like. We recommend a daily update!</p>

<p>Please be sure to check your count on our validator prior to the end of the month. We don’t want you to be surprised during last-minute validation.</p>

                    <p>On Camp NaNoWriMo, to validate your novel click “Validate your word count to win” at the top of the homepage. Winning starts on the 20th of the month and goes until the 30th or 31st, at 11:59 PM in your timezone.

<p>Winning begins on the 20th and goes until the end of the month. To validate your novel to win on NaNoWriMo:
<ol>
    <li>1. Be sure you've created a novel.</li>
    <li>2. Click "I am ready to validate my novel" in at the top of our site, where you normally enter your word count. (You can also find a text link on your novel page.)</li>
    <li>3. Copy the entire text of your 50,000-word novel and paste it into the validator box.</li>

                    <p class="question">What are badges?</p>
                    <p class="answer">Badges on the NaNoWriMo site are milestone markers, special kudos, and personal descriptors. There are two types of badges:
Participation and writing badges, which are automatically rewarded based on your achievements,
Personal achievement badges, which are self-assigned.</p>

                <div>
                    <p class="question">How do I earn participation and writing badges?</p>
                    <p class="answer">You can earn participation and writing badges by completing specific milestones on the site. 

For example, when you fill out your profile, update your word count for the first time, or post on the forums, you’ll be awarded the corresponding badge on your NaNoWriMo dashboard.

                        <p>Personal achievement badges are badges that can be self-awarded. For example, if you identify as a “Planner” or a “Pantser,” you can assign yourself the corresponding badge. </p>

<p>These differ from participation and writing badges in that they are not system awarded — it’s up to you to “claim” the personal achievement badges you feel you’ve earned (this is on the honor system, of course)! </p>
