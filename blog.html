            <p>We’re getting ready for Camp NaNoWriMo this April! What’s in your writer’s toolkit? Today, Shantea Gauthier, author and NaNoWriMo participant tells us her essential writer’s tools:</p>

            <p>I have a confession to make. I have written more than seven rough drafts using a NaNo-style rapid-fire harsh deadline. During that time, I realized that there are three things that really keep you going once the “shiny” wears off a week into your masterpiece. Those things are, in no particular order: ergonomics, an interval timer, and rewards. Trust me.</p>

            <h3 class="push-0">Take Care of Your Body</h3>

            <p>Nothing will bring your progress to a screeching halt and put it on indefinite hold like repetitive motion strain. Since ergonomics isn’t one-size-fits-all, you will have to accept this as an excuse to try out a variety of keyboards at your favorite stores or other people’s houses.</p> 

            <p>For less than $40 I was able to upgrade my keyboard to a model that works for me and an adjustable stool that fits my ridiculously tiny workspace. If you use a laptop, the best position to avoid strain is lying on your back with your knees up, with your head, neck, legs and arms supported by pillows. Your body is important. Treat it that way.
            Mind the Clock</p>

            <p>An interval timer is the tool that lets your creativity know when it’s time to work and your inner slacker know when it’s time to play. There are many free apps and websites that allow you to set up an interval timer, just find the one that’s right for you.</p>

            <p>I use an eight-minute “warm-up” to grab my coffee, limber up my hands and arms, set up my music and kiss my loved ones. Then I do 48 minutes of writing and a 12-minute break, on repeat. (If you’re just starting out, try 24 and 6, and work your way up.)</p> 

            <p>When it’s time for a break- get up and move around. No exceptions, no excuses, don’t even finish that sentence. It might take a few tries to get used to it, but it’s well worth the effort.Celebrate Your Accomplishments</p>

            <p>Rewards are vital. You don’t need to break the budget or blow your diet doing it. Reward yourself every time you sit down with special coffee or tea. When you hit your daily goal, reward yourself with an episode of that show you want to binge on Netflix. At the halfway point, buy a book on revision or a book you’ve been wanting to read.</p>

            <p>You can set aside $1 for every 10K words you write. If you finish ($50+), treat yourself! Keep the stakes low, the rewards reasonable, and remember that you are doing something very hard and very underrated. Celebrate your victories! </p>
