    <p class="">NaNoWriMo believes that:
Your story matters.
We are committed to a world that celebrates diverse voices, and encourages everyone to tell their stories.
In 2014, 803 volunteer Municipal Liaisons supported 325,142 participants on six continents.
You are capable of even more than you think.
We are committed to building writing confidence:
in a 2014 survey, 86% of respondents said that NaNoWriMo helped them learn what they can accomplish when determined.
in a 2013 independent study, 87% of student participants in our Young Writers Program said that it made them more confident writers.


You can build worlds.

We are committed to creating real-life, vibrant, literate communities, partnering hundreds of volunteers with their local libraries, bookstores, and community centers.</p>
