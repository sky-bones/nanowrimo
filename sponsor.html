<ol>
    <li>1. Be sure you've created a novel.</li>
    <li>2. Click "I am ready to validate my novel" in at the top of our site, where you normally enter your word count. (You can also find a text link on your novel page.)</li>

                    <p class="answer">Badges on the NaNoWriMo site are milestone markers, special kudos, and personal descriptors. There are two types of badges:
Participation and writing badges, which are automatically rewarded based on your achievements,
Personal achievement badges, which are self-assigned.</p>

For example, when you fill out your profile, update your word count for the first time, or post on the forums, you’ll be awarded the corresponding badge on your NaNoWriMo dashboard.

                        <p>Personal achievement badges are badges that can be self-awarded. For example, if you identify as a “Planner” or a “Pantser,” you can assign yourself the corresponding badge. </p>
